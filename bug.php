This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to undefined variables within conditional statements.  The variable `$user` might not always be defined before the `if` statement, leading to an unexpected behavior or an error. 
```php
<?php
if (isset($_POST['submit'])) {
  //The user variable is only defined if the form is submitted.
  $user = $_POST['username'];
  if ($user == "admin") {
    echo "Welcome, admin!";
  } else {
    echo "Welcome, user!";
  }
}
//Here, if the form is not submitted, the variable $user is not defined.
echo $user; //This will cause an error if the form is not submitted
?>
```
